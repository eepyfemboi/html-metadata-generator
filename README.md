# html-metadata-generator
automatically generates html metadata from given values, compatible with Google, Open Graph, Twitter Card, and all other scrapers

im currently working on a javascript version of this and once that is finished I will create a demonstration webpage that can be used to generate metadata tags

to use the python version for automation or other purposes, simply download `html_metadata_generator.py`, put it in the same folder as ur project, and use `import html_metadata_generator` and `html_metadata_generator.generate_html_metadata(**kwargs)`
